## 📚 Lessons Learned / Challenges

- Building a dashboard layout: sidebars, content panels, header  
- Organizing many UI components in a unified style  
- Using CSS grid / flexbox to manage multiple panels  
- Handling sections with mixed content (lists, tables, images)  
- Structuring the dashboard so additions or changes are easier

## 🔮 Future Improvements

Here are ideas to make the dashboard more dynamic:

- Make the dashboard **responsive** for tablets and phones  
- Add **JavaScript** for live data (charts, updating stats, interactivity)  
- Include chart libraries (e.g. Chart.js, D3.js) to show data visually  
- Add filtering / sorting for project tables, tasks, uploads  
- Implement user authentication and real data integration  
- Optimize performance (minify CSS, lazy load images)  
- Dark mode toggle
